The above image displays the plot for MTTFmin. The reliability trend displayed shows it partially in the reject area so it doesn't seem very reliable for FIO. The calculation for MTTF, in this case, is 16/286,560, which gives an MTTF of 0.000055.
![My Image](images/half.png)
The above image displays the plot for MTTFhalf. The reliability trend displayed shows it in the reject area so it doesn't seem reliable at all for FIO. The calculation for MTTF, in this case, is 8/286,560, which gives an MTTF of 0.000028.

The above image displays the plot for MTTFdouble. As plotted, the reliability trend suggests that the trend is acceptable for our FIO as it can be seen clearly that it isnt in the reject range. The calculation for MTTF, in this case, is 32/286,560, which gives an MTTF of 0.0001.
